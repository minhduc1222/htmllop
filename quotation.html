      We need your help to expose the travel companies who exploit wildlife for
      profit. When customers show they wonâ€™t support wild animals used for
      exploitative entertainment, travel companies change their policies and end
      ticket sales for these attractions. Read our report to discover the top
      five operators who are failing wildlife and help us convince them they
      have a risky and unsustainable future.
